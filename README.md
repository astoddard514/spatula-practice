Working through "A First Scraper" by James Turk

https://jamesturk.github.io/spatula/scraper-basics/

I go through the tutorial as presented, and then adapt it to scrape native plant info from https://www.minnesotawildflowers.info/. 

Things worked through: 

    x Reviewed how to set up my python virtual environment, and worked through import and dependency errors.
    - Research how to scrape text from an anchor tag/link.
    - Research how to scrape to a CSV file.
